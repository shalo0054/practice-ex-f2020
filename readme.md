## Datatypes

1. Create an Object with a series of X properties. Each property has a value that is a different type: String, Boolean, Number, null, undefined, Array, Object, and function. Assign the object to a `const`.

## Functions

1. Take the first datatype exercise and add code inside the function property to `return` the value of one of the other properties. Below the object, call the function property and assign the returned value to a new variable. Then console.log the returned value.
2. Create three functions that console log a message. Make one a function declaration, one a function expression, and the third a function expression with an arrow function.

## Arrays

1. Create an Array literal with 4 names. Create a function that accepts one parameter - an Array. The function needs to loop through the values in the Array and return a new Array where all the names have been capitalized. There are many ways to solve this. Call the function and pass in the name of arrays. `console.log()` the return value from the function.

## Loops

## if else
