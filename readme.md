# List of Practice Exercises for PA open lab sessions

## Datatypes

1. Create an Object with a series of X properties. Each property has a value that is a different type: String, Boolean, Number, null, undefined, Array, Object, and function. Assign the object to a `const`.

## Functions

1. Take the first datatype exercise and add code inside the function property to `return` the value of one of the other properties. Below the object, call the function property and assign the returned value to a new variable. Then console.log the returned value.
2. Create three functions that console log a message. Make one a function declaration, one a function expression, and the third a function expression with an arrow function.

## Arrays

1. Create an Array literal with 4 names. Create a function that accepts one parameter - an Array. The function needs to loop through the values in the Array and return a new Array where all the names have been capitalized. There are many ways to solve this. Call the function and pass in the name of arrays. `console.log()` the return value from the function.
2. Create 2 Array literals, one with a bunch of names, one with a bunch of numbers greater than 100. Write a function that will accept an array as its one parameter and sort the Array. Make sure that the number array is being sorted numerically and the names are being sorted alphabetically.
3. Create an empty Array. Use the `push()` method to add a series of 3 `Date` objects to the Array. Write a function that will sort the date array so that the dates appear in the same order that they appear during the year. Eg: January dates first, then February, then March... and so on.

## Loops

## if else
